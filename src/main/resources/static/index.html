        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I currently live in the Metro Atlanta area doing work in user experience design, technical writing, and visual design. I've worked on multiple forms of media, including websites, billboards, magazines, and professional handbooks. I pride myself on my ability to bring people of different views together in a collarborative environment. A devoted family man, I seek excellence at work for happiness at home. </p>
        <p>My portfolio contains my collected works in design. These works include visual design, webdesign, and information design projects. </p>

        <h1>SMART PANTRY</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Many people that work don't have much time to plan out meals. This problem often leads to eating out, which is both pricey and unhealthy. People could pre-plan meals, but this level of planning can take even longer than on-the-spot cooking. ​ </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Smart Pantry was my conceptual answer to this problem, as well as a practice in spacing, layout, and branding for a website. In the design, I wanted to mix modern, responsive design elements with casual motifs.

        <h1>MAMA LISA ARTISTRY</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Mama Lisa Artistry is a photography company run by Mama Lisa Robbins, a single mother and breast cancer survivor. She recently refocused her career away from make-up and hair stylist toward independent documentarian and author. With this change, her website no long fits with her brand, necessitating a thematic overhaul.</p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> When I asked Mama Lisa what she wanted from the redesign, she emphasized that she wanted the site to be “all about her." With that key idea, I crafted a design with her at the center surrounded by her life. I wanted to show visitors that her life was built on what she has created, suffered, and overcome.  </p>

        <h1>SPACEMAKERS CLOSETS</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Spacemakers Closets of Atlanta is a Georgia-based custom closet design and installation company in Marietta, Georgia. ​The original advertisement is marketed towards women with high end tastes and an income to match, as the colorful assortment of shoes and otherwise gentle palette suggests. My goal was to reimagine this advertisement for a men.
        </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Instead of sparkling white cabinets filled with colorful heels, we see dark wooden drawers and racks filled with pressed suits. A male customer can now visualize himself relishing this space. ​The main heading, “25 years, thousands of custom designed and installed professional organization solutions” provides clear numbers that give credibility to the business at a glance.

        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> The Grandstay Hotel is a chain of hotels catering to everyone from business men and women to high school graduates on a road trip. They offer several amenities and services, but many of their advertisements do not reflect the same quality of service.
        </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> The redesigned billboard provides more information on the hotel amenities and a visual of the building The faded white ensured sufficient contrast for a driver zooming by on the road to read the most important information.

        <h1>SEO PLAYBOOK</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is paramount for any professional hoping to develop a web presence, but not everyone knows all the ins and outs of SEO. While most of this information is out there it is always difficult to find and often you have to look in multiple places to see the whole picture.
        </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> This book is my personal "how to" guide to Search Engine Optimization, based on research and results I gathered while optimizing my own website, andrewroddy.com. Readers can easily identify core concepts and understand the content without having to take a formal course in SEO.

        <h1>ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Many employers need training materials to get new hires up to speed. In visual design, if a new employee doesnt have an innate sense of aesthetic, it's well worth reviewing the foundations of good design and building upon that starting point. 
        </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> For this reason, I created a beginners guide to visual design. Pages are formatted in a simple and understandable way and topics are only a page each for easy consumption. The booklet covers all of the commonly taught design elements and principles one would learn in a formal art class, but condensed into a twelve page summary of the topics. I really wanted to make something that could alleviate some of the frustration that people new to design feel.
