        <h1>SMART PANTRY</h1>
        <p>Smart Pantry is a conceptual website I designed as a class project. This site serves the purpose of finding recipes with a preselected set of ingredients. This would allow individuals to find something to cook with what they have rather than having to make a trip to the store to specifically get foods for a preplanned recipe. </p>
        <p>The purpose of the site was to show good use of space and layout design for a website. I also took the opportunity to work on branding and design a logo just for this project. It was my first attempt at branding design and I’m pretty satisfied with how it turned out. The beat has no real meaning other than that it complemented the palette I was going to use for the site. I choose a neutral base color to make it easy on the eyes and to help the other colors pop. Green was chosen as a highlight color because green is associated with freshness and red was used because it has a tendency to make people hungry. I felt both of these colors gave the site a good feeling for someone looking for something to eat.
