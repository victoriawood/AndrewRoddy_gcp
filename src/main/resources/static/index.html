        <h1>SMART PANTRY</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Many people that work have difficulty finding time to figure out meals based on what they have in their kitchen. This problem often leads to eating out, which is a more expensive and less healthy alternative to cooking. People could pre-plan meals, but this level of planning can take even longer than on-the-spot cooking. ​ </p>
        <p>Smart Pantry was my conceptual answer to this problem, as well as a practice in spacing, layout, and branding for a website. I choose a neutral base color to make it easy on the eyes and to help the other colors pop. Green was chosen as a highlight color because green is associated with freshness and red was used because it has a tendency to make people hungry. I felt both of these colors gave the site a good feeling for someone looking for something to eat.

        <h1>MAMA LISA ARTISTRY</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Mama Lisa Artistry is a photography company run by Mama Lisa Robbins, a single mother and breast cancer survivor. She has recently refocused her career away from make-up and hair stylist toward independent documentarian and author. With this change, her website no long fits with the style or movement of her career path and needed a thematic overhaul.</p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> When I asked Mama Lisa what she wanted from the redesign, she emphasized that she wanted the site to be “all about her”. I took that as the key idea and crafted a design with her at the center surrounded by the things she does and enjoys. I wanted to show visitors that her life was built on what she has created, suffered, and overcome. I wanted to portray her life as a story that people will want to listen to and watch. </p>

        <h1>SPACEMAKERS CLOSETS</h1>
        <p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Spacemakers Closets of Atlanta is a Georgia-based custom closet design and installation company in Marietta, Georgia. Operating for over 25 years in the southeast, the company has designed and installed thousands of custom bedroom closets, garages, pantries, and other storage spaces. ​The original advertisement is marketed towards women with high end tastes and an income to match, as the colorful assortment of shoes and otherwise gentle palette suggests. The goal of my redesign was to reimagine this advertisement for a male audience.
        </p>
        <p><b>SOLUTION:</b> Instead of sparkling white cabinets filled with colorful heels, we see dark wooden drawers and racks filled with pressed suits and loafers. A male customer can now visualize himself using and relishing this space. ​The redesign sought to satisfy the need for data by changing the main text to include facts taken from the Spacemakers' website. The main heading, “25 years, thousands of custom designed and installed professional organization solutions” provides clear numbers that give credibility to the business at a glance.
